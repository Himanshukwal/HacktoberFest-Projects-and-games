# Huffman_Code
Implemented the Huffman coding into a given text. Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The program reads a given text file and assigns variable length codes to each unique input character. The idea is to replace the most frequent character with the smallest code and the least frequent character with the largest code.  The program displays the Huffman codes for each unique character, the number of characters, the total frequency,  the total bits required to print in Characters and the total bits required to print in Huffman Coding. We write a file with the Huffman Codes for each character in the given text file. In the end, we decode the Huffman Code file and print the actual content given in the text file.
